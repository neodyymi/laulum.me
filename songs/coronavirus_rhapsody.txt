Coronavirus Rhapsody

Is this a fever?
Is this just allergies?
Caught in a lockdown
No escape from the family

Don’t touch your eyes
Just hand sanitize quicklyyyyy
I’m just a poor boy, no job security
Because of easy spread, even though
I washed my hands, laying low
I look out the window, the curve doesn’t look flatter to me, to me

Mama, I just killed a man
I didn’t stay inside in bed
I walked past him, now he’s dead
Mama, life was so much fun
But now I’ve got this unforgiving plague

Mama, oooooh
I didn’t mean to make them die
If I’m not back to work this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if people didn’t matter

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Social isolation time
Goodbye everybody, I hope it’s just the flu
I’ve got to leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, oooooh
(just look out the window) 
I don’t wanna die
I sometimes wish I never went out at all

I see a little silhouette of a man
What a douche, what a douche
Did he even wash his hands though
No toilet paper frightening 
Very very frightening me
Gotta lay low (gotta lay low)
Gotta lay low (gotta lay low)
Gotta lay low masturbate
Masturbate O O O O

I’m just a poor boy, facing mortality
HE’S JUST A POOR BOY FACING MORTALITY
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Touch your face, wash your hands, will you wash your hands?
BISMILLAH! NO! WE WILL NOT WASH OUR HANDS! (WASH YOUR HANDS!)
BISMILLAH! WE WILL NOT WASH OUR HANDS! (WASH YOUR HANDS)
BISMILLAH! WE WILL NOT WASH OUR HANDS! (WASH YOUR HANDS!)
WILL NOT WASH OUR HANDS! (never, never, wash our hands no)
No no no no no no no
Oh mama mia, mama  mia (MAMA MIA WASH YOUR HANDS!!)
COVID-19 has a sickness put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stop me and just shake my hand?
So you think we can hang out and not break our plans?
Oh baby, can’t do this with me, baby
Just gotta stay home, I hope I don’t run out of beer

Oooooooooh
Ooh yeah!
Ooh yeah!
The curve could get much flatter
Anyone can see
The curve could get much flatter
You know it’s your responsibility 

Just look out your window
